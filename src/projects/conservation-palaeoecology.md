description: A study of existing literature to analyze the value of palaeoecological data in the conservation and restoration of oceanic islands. Put simply, to determine whether an island's past is essential in protecting and restoring its current flora and fauna. This resulted in a well-argumented call to action for researchers to put their research to practical use, as their historic data was essential for restoration efforts. The project taught me how to properly gather, analyze, and recontextualize existing research, as well as on how to craft an engaging narrative supporting a particular fact or opinion, and how to handle lots of feedback.
