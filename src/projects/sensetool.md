description: A web application built for a single organization, helping them anonymously register and report incoming contacts to SOA Aids Nederland, a Dutch government-funded organization providing sexual education and advice. The application was completely rebuilt in Symfony as part of my first major project, which taught me much about Symfony functionality, proper cooperation between team disciplines, and how to properly construct a back-end application.
