description: CardBoard CX was a SaaS web application enabling contact centers to easily create wallboard displays showing real-time data from their contact center platforms. It successfully offered a specialized yet user-friendly alternative to existing products, which often did not offer proper platform integrations or were difficult to use. Its development taught me more about the asynchronous loading of data, connecting to external systems, and providing user-friendly solutions to relatively complex problems. It also prompted creative yet efficient solutions for the database structure.
