description: Branches CX was a SaaS web application that helped contact centers create complex decision trees and provided analytics to help improve and streamline the contact process. It was especially popular with hospitals, where it helpd replace inefficient analog processes. An interesting project to work on, with challenges revolving around efficient retrieval of statisics, loading complex nested decision trees, calculating their use, and making the whole process user-friendly. In a broader context, it helped me better judge the importance and impact of major refactors and redesigns, as well as how to minimize inconveniencing its users during.
