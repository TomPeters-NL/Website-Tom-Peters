description: Cerberus was an API platform responsible for the authentication and authorization of requests in a SaaS product suite ecosystem. Much like its mythological namesake, it ensured tha authenticity and security of incoming and outgoing connections to the central management API, Anoctua. The project had me researching proper, secure communication between APIs, Symfony security, user authentication, and multi-level request authentication. Much like a good puzzle, it was a thought-provoking, challenging, and fun to solve.
