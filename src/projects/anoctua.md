description: Anoctua was a web application which served as an API platform for centralized user, end-client, and partner management for the company's SaaS product suite. It was built to serve as an API first, but to allow for future integration with a front-end framework. This project allowed me to carefully consider how each choice made in its (technical) design would impact and fit the entire ecosystem. Creating this ecosystem from scratch was challenging, stimulating, and most of all, fun.
