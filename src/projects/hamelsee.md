role: Researcher, Coring Crew, Student
description: Centered around lake Hämelsee in Germany, this project allowed me to work as part of the European INTIMATE initiative (INTegrating Ice core, MArine and TErrestrial records). I helped recover sediment cores from the lake, extract samples from them, and then identified sub-fossil chironomids (i.e., midge larvae), which helped infer past temperatures in the area around 12,000 years ago; which showed a rapid warming event at the onset of our current time period. It was fascinating to be part of a large multi-disciplinary team, allowing me to network, cooperate, communicate, review, and discuss with fellow researchers.
