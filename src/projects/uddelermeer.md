description: My first academic research project aiming to create a palaeoecological reconstruction of the area surrounding lake Uddelermeer, the Netherlands. I analyzed sub-fossil pollen under a microscope, allowing us to reconstruct the plant life surrounding the lake over the past 12,800 years, and ultimately identify an interesting lake lowstand. This result helped us better understand local climate and contributed to our understanding of past climate change in Europe as a whole. This project kickstarted my fascination with palaeoecology, helped me develop my academic skillset, and motivated me to keep pursuing an academic career.
