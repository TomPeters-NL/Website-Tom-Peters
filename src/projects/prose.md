description: My first foray into back-end development, Prose was a prototype contact center scripting application. It was intended to offer contact center managers with an easy and accessibly way to create and customize their agents' experience during customer contact. I worked on this project alongside another trainee and a senior full-stack developer. It lasted around six months, during which I was introduced to programming staples, such as the use of frameworks, Git, and Agile work environments. It was a very dense and steep learning curve, which I enjoyed a lot and motivated me to keep learning and improving my craft.
