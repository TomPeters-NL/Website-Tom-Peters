description: A chemical and taxonomic analysis of leaves from the Peruvian Andes, performed in Los Angeles, in order to determine whether the composition of leaf waxes from the Peruvian rainforest and cloud forest were more dependent on their environment or the type of plant. Ultimately, we were able to provide evidence for an evolutionary response by plants to their environment. The project allowed me to work with North-American, South-American, and European colleagues halfway across the globe. The whole experience was invaluable both personally and professionally; from living by myself abroad to new research methods and being part of a intercontinental research network.
