position: Back-end Developer
description: I started off as a junior back-end developer responsible for rebuilding a ColdFusion web application using Symfony 3. With time, I became one of the driving forces behind the Development department and its infrastructure, technology, and projects. I was the head back-end developer and technical lead for five projects; three SaaS products, an internal authentication and authorization hub, and a central management portal. Beyond that, I managed the company's GitLab, Jira, Confluence, DNIS, CI/CD, and server organization.
