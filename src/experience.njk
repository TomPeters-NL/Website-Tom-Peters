        <div class="company-description">
            I started out as a Junior Back-end Developer responsible for rebuilding a ColdFusion web application into a modern <span>PHP</span> application. As time passed, I soon became one of the
            driving forces behind the Development department, its infrastructure, its technology, and its projects.
            <br><br>
            Part of the main <span>Agile</span> web development team, I was the primary back-end developer for five projects: three SaaS products, an internal authentication and security hub, and a
            management portal. Beyond that, I managed the company's <span>GitLab</span>, <span>Jira</span>, and <span>Confluence</span> environments, as well as managing <span>server content</span>,
            <span>DNIS</span>, and <span>CI/CD</span>.

        <div class="company-description">
            I was part of True Legends' Young Talent Traineeship, in whic those who received a formal education outside of IT were trained in project management and software development. My
            traineeship was mostly geared towards software development, preparing me for eventually becoming a back-end developer.
            <br><br>
            As the company was primarily a deployment agency, one of my projects was the development of the back-end for a call center scripting application for a company that turned out to be my
            future employer.

        <div class="company-description">
            Following my Bachelor's in Biology, I started a Master's in Biological Sciences with a particular focus on the "Ecology and Evolution" track, due to my fascination with
            <span>palaeoecology</span>.
            This particular Master's program consisted mostly of two research projects and a literature thesis:
            <br><br>
            <em>Climatic change at lake HÃ¤melsee: a chironomid-based reconstruction of temperatures during the Younger Dryas - Preboreal transition</em> (2014; University of Amsterdam)
            <br><br>
            <em>Conservation Palaeoecology: The application of palaeoecological research in the conservation and restoration of oceanic islands</em> (2014; University of Amsterdam & Utrecht
            University)
            <br><br>
            <em>Environment or Taxonomy? Identifying the major drivers of leaf wax traits diversity in the Peruvian rainforest and cloud forest</em> (2015; University of Amsterdam & University of
            Southern California)
