I started out as a Junior Back-end Developer responsible for rebuilding a ColdFusion web application into a modern PHP application. As time passed, I soon became one of the driving forces behind the
Development department, its infrastructure, its technology, and its projects.
<br><br>
Part of the main Agile web development team, I was the primary back-end developer for five projects: three SaaS products, an internal authentication and security hub, and a management portal. Beyond
that, I managed the company's GitLab, Jira, and Confluence environments, as well as managing server content, DNIS, and CI/CD.

I was part of True Legends' Young Talent Traineeship, in whic those who received a formal education outside of IT were trained in project management and software development. My traineeship was mostly
geared towards software development, preparing me for eventually becoming a back-end developer.
<br><br>
As the company was primarily a deployment agency, one of my projects was the development of the back-end for a call center scripting application for a company that turned out to be my future employer.

Following my Bachelor's in Biology, I started a Master's in Biological Sciences with a particular focus on the "Ecology and Evolution" track, due to my fascination with palaeoecology.
This particular Master's program consisted mostly of two research projects and a literature thesis:
<br><br>
<em>Climatic change at lake HÃ¤melsee: a chironomid-based reconstruction of temperatures during the Younger Dryas - Preboreal transition</em> (2014; University of Amsterdam)
<br><br>
<em>Conservation Palaeoecology: The application of palaeoecological research in the conservation and restoration of oceanic islands</em> (2014; University of Amsterdam & Utrecht University)
<br><br>
<em>Environment or Taxonomy? Identifying the major drivers of leaf wax traits diversity in the Peruvian rainforest and cloud forest</em> (2015; University of Amsterdam & University of Southern
California)

My Bachelor's in Biology consisted of three years of increasingly specialized topics. My particular interest was in ecology, which ultimately culminated in my fascination for palaeoecology and a
related graduation thesis:
<br><br>
<em>A Late Holocene Lake-Level Lowstand - A Case Study on Lake-Level Changes at Uddelermeer, the Netherlands</em> (2013; University of Amsterdam)
