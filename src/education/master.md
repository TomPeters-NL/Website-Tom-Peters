description: A two-year program in the "Ecology and Evolution" track, with a personal focus on palaeoecology. While I did attend several courses, the majority of the program was spent on two research projects and a literature thesis. These truly enabled me to broaden my knowledge, skillset, and mindset in preparation for a career of academic research.
projects:
    - 'Climatic change at lake HÃ¤melsee: a chironomid-based reconstruction of temperatures during the Younger Dryas - Preboreal transition (2014; University of Amsterdam)'
    - 'Conservation Palaeoecology: The application of palaeoecological research in the conservation and restoration of oceanic islands (2014; University of Amsterdam & Utrecht University)'
    - Environment or Taxonomy? Identifying the major drivers of leaf wax traits diversity in the Peruvian rainforest and cloud forest (2015; University of Amsterdam & University of Southern California)
