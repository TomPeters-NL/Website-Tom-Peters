title: Bachelor of Science
subject: Biology
school: University of Amsterdam
description: My Bachelor's in Biology consisted of three years of increasingly specialized topics, ranging from cellular chemistry and ecology to statistical analysis. My particular interest was in ecology, which culminated in a fascination for palaeoecology. These three years laid the foundation for the academic mindset, which I use to analyze and solve issues to this day.
